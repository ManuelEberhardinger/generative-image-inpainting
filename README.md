The focus of this project was to learn the theory of GANs and other computer vision techniques.
A lot of the code is copied from the original tensorflow implementation and from the pytorch version
(https://github.com/WonwoongCho/Generative-Inpainting-pytorch) because of the missing time and the training duration of the networks.
